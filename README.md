# learning julia

this repo is me learning julia and tbh julia is really easy

## why i think julia is easy

its basically python and lua combined

## btw

i learned lua in like 10 minutes ik that this is not enough to write real programs and scripts and such but like cmon we always start with the basics i'll learn more advanced julia stuff by trying to build projects and then when i get stuck i go to ~~google~~ duckduckgo (unironically)

## julia is love

julia is life

## final vertict

its cool ig
